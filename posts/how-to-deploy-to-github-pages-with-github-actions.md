## Intro

If you know about CI and Github Pages in general, you can skip this section and go straight to the [action](#lets-start) (github action!)!

If you just want the `.yml` config code, you can find it in the [conclusion](#conclusion).

I have done my fair share of website deploying with good ol' FTP over the years. You simply copy the files to the server and you're good to go. There are however, many downsides of taking that approach which I'm not gonna dive into right now, maybe another post.

### CI in a nutshell

Nowadays, we do things more automatically with the use of CI (Continuous Integration). TLDR: You integrate the development, version control, build, testing, and deployment of your website into one beautiful continous cycle, that usually goes:

```sequence
code > commit > pull request > tests > build > merge > deploy
```

The steps from tests to deploy are usually handled by some CI service. There are many like [Circle CI](circleci.org), [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), and, the one we'll be using here, [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), among MANY others. The reason I mentioned these 3 in specific is that I have used them in the past, and know that they have free plans to get you started. These free plans are probably more than you need for smaller/personal projects.

What these services do is basically run a bunch of shell commands on some server somewhere. You usually have to configure what commands will be executed. There are exceptions, such as (Vercel)[vercel.com] which specializes in Next.js projects and does everything that needs to be done out of the box, so that may be a good solution for you.

### Github Pages TLDR

Github Pages is a free service from github that serves website pages straight from your repo. Keep in mind that you must leave the website public for this to work, so don't use it if you have sensistive code there. In my case, it was perfect, as my website can also serve as a showcase of my work/coding,

**Important Info:** Github Pages will, by default, process your pages as if they were built with Jekyll, a blog aware static website generator. If you are not using that, we'll have to tell github pages to skip this step. If you are using jekyll however, you don't even need CI or anything.

Github pages can serve pages from a variety of sources. You can have your pages in a `gh-pages` branch, or in a `docs` folder inside your master branch. Visit [The Docs](https://pages.github.com/) to find out more. We'll be deploying it to the `gh-pages` branch here.

### Github Actions

Github actions is a free-to-start CI service from github. There are many pre-made actions that do specific jobs for you. For instance, in this guide we'll be using an action that deploys to github pages using the gh-pages lib.

## Let's start!

Enough with the chatter, let's get going.

### Step 1: Your project

First of all, you will need your project (do I even have to say that?).

In my case, I'll be using my own website as an example. This website is build with Next.js. Next.js has the ability to generate a static website (plain old HTML + CSS + JS) that can be run directly in the browser. Here are a few tips for different kind of websites:

- **Plain HTML**: If you are building a plain html static website, you are good to go! Skip to the next step.
- **React project**: You will need to know about the `build` script, that generates a production ready build of your project.
- **Next.js project**: In next, you will need to know about the `build` and `export` scripts, that will make the website ready for deploy.
- **Any other whatever.js project**: You probably have gotten the gist of it by now, just see the docs of your framework on how to make a production build.

#### REALLY Important Info:

If your project **CANNOT** contain server side rendering (code that runs on the server side after the build) for this. Github pages can only serve a static HTML in the end, there is no server running behind that we can take control of. 

For instance, my website has Next.js' `getStaticProps` emplyed in some pages. While this **is** server side code, it only runs at build time and that's fine. If I had been using `getServerSideProps` anywhere it wouldn't work. In that case, I would have to rewrite my code to make data fetching and other stuff that might be going on in the server side to happen at run time on the client side (like instead of querying a database directly, we would instead do a `fetch` on an API)

### Step 2: Github Repo Name & Settings

You will need your project to be in a github repo named as such:

```
username.github.io
```

In my case, it's `lipe-dev.github.io`.

You can, also, make a github pages homepage for your projects instead of making one for your user. In that case the project name can be whatever you want, and after you configure github pages to serve your website it will be on the address: `username.github.io/project-name`

And under that project's settings page, you will need to configure Github pages like so:

![Github Pages Example](/images/posts/gh-pages-config.png)

Note that I have https and a custom domain setup, do NOT do that right now. We will configure that later after we're done. It's a whole another can of worms to deal with.

### Step 3: Github Actions Configuration

Here is where the fun begins.

I will not be going too in depth with the config file syntax here, because: 1 - I am not an expert, and 2 - There is just way too much to cover here. So let's begin with the basics to get rolling:

The plan here is to set up the workflow to go as follows:

1. A new push or pull request happens on Master branch (that will be our "ready for prod" branch)
2. The CI server picks up the updated code with a git checkout
3. The CI server will set up the Node.js enviroment (which I need in my case, you may need something else)
4. The CI server will install the project's dependencies (dev dependencies are installed here too), in my case, with `yarn`
5. The CI server will generate the production build (I'm using Next.js build scripts here, you might be using something else)
6. The CI server will tell github pages (not really) to not process this using Jekyll (because mine is built with Next.js)
7. The CI server will push the built code to the `gh-pages` branch, thus finishing the deploy process.

The github actions configuration is done in the `.github/workflows/` folder at the root of your project. You can manually create a `main.yml` file there and add the contents below. However we'll take a look at the Github actions interface first.

First of all, let's create the workflow. Go to https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io/actions (this is the Actions link on the top of your project) and click the "New Workflow" button.

Here you can see there is a lot of pre-made workflows for you to choose from. Take a look at those later, as there might be ready-to-use solutions that will work for your projects. We will be going with the "setup a workflow yourself" option.

Github will make a simple bloilerplate workflow for you. It's pretty well documented with comments, so take a read there to understand what it does. Let's start workflow-ing our plan from before:

The `on` config tells github actions to run this action on pushes and pull requests to the master branch, which is what we want.
For now, let's just remove the useless "echo" job steps from our build job.

**`.github/workflows/main.yml`**
```diff
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
# Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run 
#   sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as 
    #   part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, 
      #     so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

-      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
-      - name: Run a one-line script
-        run: echo Hello, world!

-      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
-      - name: Run a multi-line script
-        run: |
-          echo Add other actions to build,
-          echo test, and deploy your project.
```

The first step of the plan is already there. It's the checkout code. Note that we are just calling another pre-made action, called `actions/checkout@v2`. This action will get the code from our repo to the CI machine and we don't have to manually write the commands. This action includes some optimization as well. 
<sup><sub>emoji added for fancyness</sub><sup> 

```yaml
- name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, 
      #   so your job can access it
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

Next (.js? huh? get it? next.js?), we will be setting up the node enviroment on the CI machine. Github actions provides us with this handy option that we can add.

Once again, we are using another pre-made action, called `action/setup-node@v1`. It expects a `with` parameter specifying a version. If for some reason you need to build using more than one node versions you can also pass an array there, and you can be as specific with the version numbers as you want. 12.x is fine for me.

**`.github/workflows/main.yml`**
```diff
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, 
      #     so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

+      # Define a Node.js version to use
+      - name: Use Node.js üì¶
+        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
+        with:
+          node-version: '12.x'
```

Now we can move on to installing dependencies and building the code with yarn (or use npm, or whatever tool you use)

**`.github/workflows/main.yml`**
```diff
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
      #     so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Define a Node.js version to use
      - name: Use Node.js üì¶
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '12.x'

+      # Build using next build and next export
+      - name: Install and Build üîß
+        run: |
+          yarn install --frozen-lockfile
+          yarn build
```

In my case, with Next.js, there is now an `/out` directory in my project with the results of this build. I know that `create-react-app`'s scripts will create a `/build` folder. Other frameworks will have different results. Check the documentation for yours by looking for "Making a production build on [whatever you're using]"

*Intermission:* This folder contains a static website with plain html, css and js files. We are deploying this to Github pages, which will by default process it with Jekyll. We don't want that here, but if you're deploying to somewhere else that does not have anything to do with Jekyll, you're probably good to go. If your project is in jekyll, well, you're also set.

Github pages will not process your website with jekyll if you add an empty `.nojekyll` file at the root of it. So let's go ahead and add one to our `/out` folder.

> Don't forget this special *touch*...

**`.github/workflows/main.yml`**
```diff
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
      #     so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Define a Node.js version to use
      - name: Use Node.js üì¶
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '12.x'

      # Build using next build and next export
      - name: Install and Build üîß
        run: |
          yarn install --frozen-lockfile
          yarn build
+          touch out/.nojekyll
```

We are pretty much done! All that is left to do is send this code to the `gh-pages` branch of our repo. There is a very hand action for that called `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.6.1`. Send JamesIves my regards, and thanks. Also I stole the emojis idea from their example.

**`.github/workflows/main.yml`**
```diff
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
      #     so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Define a Node.js version to use
      - name: Use Node.js üì¶
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '12.x'

      # Build using next build and next export
      - name: Install and Build üîß
        run: |
          yarn install --frozen-lockfile
          yarn build
          touch out/.nojekyll

+      # Deploy with/to github pages
+      - name: Deploy üöÄ
+        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.6.1
+        with:
+          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
+          BRANCH: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
+          FOLDER: out # The folder the action should deploy.
+          CLEAN: true # Auto-Remove deleted files from the deploy branch
```

This action uses the `gh-pages` package to make the push. Here are some info about the params we passed there:
-*GITHUB_TOKEN* is provided automatically by github to the CI server, you don't need to change anything there unless it's not working.
-*BRANCH* is the branch where we are sending the `/out` folder to. You can send to others, if you want to configure github pages to serve something else.
-*FOLDER* is the resulting folder form our build, in this case `/out`

And that's it! Congratulations, your website will now be deployed automatically to github pages.

## Conclusion

This is a pretty straight forward process, and a great way for people who never used CI before to get their toes wet. On top of that, you now have a website running for free on Github's servers!

Make sure you read the docs on Github's website to see the limitations, but a static page probably won't break them. Here is what the finished config file looks like:

Now just go ahead and push some code (it can even be just this yml code!) to your master branch on github, or make a pull request, and you will see a magic server somewhere executing this workflows in the Actions tab!

**`.github/workflows/main.yml`**
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, 
      #   so your job can access it
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Define a Node.js version to use
      - name: Use Node.js üì¶
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '12.x'

      # Build using next build and next export
      - name: Install and Build üîß
        run: |
          yarn install --frozen-lockfile
          yarn build
          touch out/.nojekyll

      # Deploy with/to github pages
      - name: Deploy üöÄ
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.6.1
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          FOLDER: out # The folder the action should deploy.
          CLEAN: true # Auto-Remove deleted files from the deploy branch
```

## Final Tips

- You can make different workflows for pull requests to just make them check if tests pass, the project builds and linters are followed correctly, and save the deploy part just for merges on the master branch.

- You can separate steps in different jobs to run them in parallel if possible (or make them sequential with one requiring other)

- Even if you are using Jekyll, you can have an action to push the code from master to wherever you want github pages to serve it from

If you have any questions, or just wanna talk, [reach out!](/chat) I'll be thrilled to hear about it.
