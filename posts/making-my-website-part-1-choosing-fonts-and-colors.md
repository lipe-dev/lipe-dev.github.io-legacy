# Intro

I've been meaning to renew my online home for a while now. I finally found the time between my freelance and regular work to do so. Let's begin.

I am a firm believer that everything I make should be done mindfully, and everything should have some meaning and reason behind it. That is surely the case when it comes to choosing even the minor details of designing a website, specially when it's my own.

The first step during the creation of this website was pick colors and fonts that represent me well. In order to achieve my goal, I went into some internal analysis about who I am as a professional and person. In the end my choices were comprised of an Orange and Blue color scheme accompanied by the Cairo and Source Sans/Code.

# Picking Colors

Choosing a color scheme is at the same time the most important and the easiest task when making a website for me. Color schemes often are created based on the client's branding, or in my personal website's case by picking my favorite colors and matching them.

## Primary Color

The primary color of my website was pretty obvious to me: Orange. Orange is my favorite color since I was a little kid wearing my favorite orange tank-top, which I nicknamed "Mirinda". Mirinda was my favorite brand of Orange Soda back then.

I recently fell in love with [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/). And they really have a beautiful color palette. I Settled for the Orange-400 as it seemed to be the most pleasant to look at. This is the color you will see all over this website (probably have already seen).

With the primary color in hand, the choice of secondary/accent color was easy.

## Secondary Color

The secondary color I picked for my website is also very special to me. Moreover, it's very special to someone who is very special to me. It's my beautiful wife's favorite color.

Just like I was sure the first time I saw her that we would someday be together, I was sure that no other color would be a better fit for my accent color. Dark Blue it is.

Just like her and me, Orange and Blue are complementary colors, on opposite sides of the color wheel, a perfect tinder match (we actually met on tinder 5 years ago!).

Once again, TailwindCSS helped me pick my blue. I decided to go with the Blue-900 variant, as it is the darkest version of the blue color it has, and I really liked how it matched with the lighter version of Orange I picked. You will see it popping here and there.

With my color scheme locked in, it was time for the hardest task: finding fonts that suit me.

# Picking Fonts

Picking a font is hard.

At first, I tried studying the meaning of the many available fonts (of which one of my favorites is Gidole's). However, more often than not fonts are meant to convey some sort of info, and not really meant to have a deep meaning behind them (at least not one that I could find).

Then I decided to step it down a little and settle by finding fonts readily available at Google Fonts, which is a convenient, free and effective way of using web based typefaces on websites.

## Main Font - A programmer lives by the code.

Upon first inspection the main font was easily spotted. Source Sans Pro, which I quickly added to the body style of my website, to act as the main font. You probably know why I decided to pick this one: Its name! As someone who does coding for a living, having fonts that ping back to that really speaks to me. Therefore, Source Sans is my main font and Source Code is my syntax highlighting/monospace font.

## Display Font - Is that a JoJo's Reference???

Finally, it was time to find a display kind of font for headers and such. I decided that I want to give a nod to something I do for fun. One of the things I like the most is watching Japanese animations, of which my all time favorite is Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. There is a long tradition (even in western culture) to reference Jojo's and I decided to do the same.

After searching for a while, my stardust cruzade around the world of fonts available, I reached my destination: Cairo. Just like the JoJo team does in Stardust Cruzaders.

# Conclusion

Was all of this work worth the effort? Absolutely. I can finally say that my website truly represents me so far.

My website has my favorite color, my loved one's favorite color, a font that represents my work as a programmer, and a font that expresses my favorite piece of art.

Looking from an outsider view, this might seem like a waste of time, but this is definitely not the case. Like my wife always says:
