{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"python","contentHtml":"<h1>Intro</h1>\n<p>Python is my favorite programming language. Period. There is no way to deny how cool this language is and how much power it gives us developers to do whatever we want.</p>\n<p>There are people using Python for the most amazing things, and in every field, and the best part is that anyone can do it. Python is incredibly easy to learn AND master. There are people from fields varying from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXNB1BbKY8A\">music making</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6920002/\">medical research</a> doing great work using Python.</p>\n<p>Python is here to stay, and I’m glad I’m here to see where it goes, and more important than the tech, I’m here to see what the people will do with it. With Python 3.9 coming, there is sure a lot of exciting <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html\">new possibilities</a>.</p>\n<h1>My first project</h1>\n<p>My first experience with Python was, like a lot of people, back in college, when I did some experiments related to data mining. Even as someone who had never worked a single line of Python before, learning and using it was leagues easier than anything I had worked with before. In one week I went from zero to some cool vector calculations with NumPy. This is an experiment with particle swarm optimization for K-means clustering. You can actually see the code I pieced together from various sources right <a href=\"https://github.com/lipe-dev/PSOKMeans\">here on my github</a>.</p>\n<p>While it’s not the prettiest piece of code you will ever see, I’m really proud of what I was able to build, even if in a lot of cases I had to copy paste code from here and there.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but this project also showed me how well Python performs when doing multiple calculations as well. Even with my poorly optimized code, it could munch through a lot of data very fast!</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I was able to build this without any previous knowledge of the language, and it made advanced calculations using Vectors A LOT easier than the languages I was experimenting with prior to this.</p>\n<h1>My recent Python experience</h1>\n<p>Currently I am not working with python, while it is still my favorite language, my favorite area of work is the front-end, which means lots of JavaScript (don’t get me wrong, I love JS too!). Maybe someone will make it possible to do front-end for the web with python soon? But I digress, while I am not currently working with Python, I still have a lot of contact with it. Python is the main language in <a href=\"https://loadsmart.com\">Loadsmart's backend</a> where I currently work, and very often I have to get in touch with it.</p>\n<p>I was very involved with empreguei.com in the past, a sort of “tinder” for jobs where you can match with companies and/or potential employees. Really cool matchmaking stuff with Python on the backend there, that I may describe in more detail another day. Unfortunately, some time after I left the company they have gone out of business and there is no way to see any of that at work currently.</p>\n<p>Right now I am working with React on <a href=\"loadsmart.com\">loadsmart.com</a> where I help US truck drivers and shipping companies find loads to move with little effort, while helping companies ship their products at lower costs with tracking &#x26; more visibility, with just a few clicks! Move more with less! And while on one hand I’m exclusively working with front-end, all our backend is Python, with cool data science Pandas stuff and all of that, and I can still be involved with the language every now and then.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Python is great. There is not much else that I can say. It is here to stay, and I would love to stick around long enough to see what creative and hard working people can make with it. In addition to that, I would love to contribute more myself too when I find the right chance.</p>\n<p>Maybe I'll go back to full-stack programming to get back into the Python action in the future, for now I've been learning how to use <a href=\"https://www.pygame.org/news\">PyGame</a> in my spare time, just for fun and making silly games.</p>\n","title":"Python","date":"2020-09-16","categories":["tech"],"banner":"/images/posts/python.jpg","image":"https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png","excerpt":"Python is the GOAT language!
